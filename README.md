# Simple_compiler
A simple C++ compiler reads source code, tokenizes it, parses syntax, generates an abstract syntax tree (AST), and translates it into machine code or intermediate code. It consists of a lexer, parser, semantic analyzer, and code generator. It can use LLVM or other backends for optimization and execution.
